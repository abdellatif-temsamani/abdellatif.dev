## About

Hi, I'm Abdellatif, a passionate self-taught Full Stack web developer and a
freelance software engineer from Morocco. My passion for software lies with
dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take
great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I
build.

[abdellatif.dev](abdellatif.dev) is my personal website, where I share my
freelance services and my case studies. I also write articles about software
engineering and development trends.
